INSTALL
-------

It is neccessary to have these dependencies:

libpcap (+libpcap-dev)
libxml2

It is possible to compile and install the program using these three commands:

make 		- compiles pcf and log_reader (Compiler supporting C++0x is necessary)
make install	- installs the program to the bin/ directory
make clean	- removes binary files from src/ directory

UNINSTALL
---------

To uninstall pcf run (in src/ directory):

make uninstall

Binary files stored in bin/ directory are removed. Data saved in other
directories and configuration files are not removed.
WARNING! Following install procedure will replace the configuration file with
the one stored in src/ directory.

RUN TIME DEPENDENCIES

WEB INTERFACE
-------------

In order to run web interface you have to configure your web server. PHP
module is necessary to run the web interface.

The root directory is www/, graphs are stored in www/graph. Ensure that
www/data/database.xml, www/data/javascript/database.xml, and
www/data/database.xml are writeable by WWW server in order to save clock skew of
recognized computers.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Documentation can be automatically created by doxygen:

make doc - creates documentation in doc/ directory

By default HTML and LaTeX documentation is created.
