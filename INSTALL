libxml2

It is possible to compile and install the program using these three commands:

make 		- compiles pcf
make install	- installs the program to the bin/ directory
make clean	- removes binary files from src/ directory

Note: if you experience bugs like "stack smashing detected" in
https://github.com/polcak/pcf/issues/1, please recompile the program using
"make donotreduce" and install again.

UNINSTALL

Binary files stored in bin/ directory are removed. Data saved in other
directories and configuration files are not removed.
