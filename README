This is a README file for pcf -- a tool for remote computer identification. The
identification is done according to skew of the clocks inside each computer.
Clock skew of a specific computer is computed from TCP timestamps. The program
runs in an infinite loop and its output is a XML file containing recognized
computers. The program was developed and tested in GNU/Linux.

For install and uninstall instructions see INSTALL file.

Usage
-----

Program has to be run as root or it has to have capabilities to listen for data
on network interfaces.

Usage: pcf [Options] [Interface]

  -h		Help
  -n		Number of packets to capture (0 -- default means infinity)
  -t		Number of seconds to capture (0 -- default means infinity)
  -p		Port number (1-65535, 0 -- default means all)

Examples:
  pcf
  pcf -n 100 -t 600 -p 80 wlan0

The first example runs the program according to parameters listed in the config
file.

It is possible to stop the program by sending SIGINT or SIGTERM.

You can find more instructions about program configuration in the config file.
All options are commented.

You can configure your web server and enable web interface. You can see
recognized computers and manage them in your browser.


Files and directories
---------------------

bin/		- binary files (installed version of the program)
src/		- source files

src/
  pcf		- program pcf
  gen_pics.sh	- converts graphs from postscrip to jpeg
  config	- configuration file

  graph/	- graphs of the recognized computers
  http_traffic/	- debug python script which is able to generate HTTP traffic (it
      is not necessary to run this program for correct operation of pcf)
  log/		- files containing log of drifts of monitored computers. These files
      required for graph construction.
  www/		- web interface


Note
----

WARNING! When you stop the program, data stored in the file with active
computers are lost. Information about unsaved computers will be forever lost.

The files with active and saved computers are implicitly stored in
www/data/active.xml and www/data/database.xml. Please follow install
instructions for more informations how to setup permissions for those files.

The variable BLOCK in config file set a limit after which the pcf re-computes
clock skews, generates graphs etc. The program implicitly reduces number of
stored packets after 5-times BLOCK packets are received and then after each
block. When more then 100-times BLOCK packets are received the oldest packets
are deleted from program memory.

Program does not process packets with lower or the same time stamp as was
already seen for earlier packet. This is positive in most situations but if a
computer is restarted than pcf is not able to detect this and cope with the
situation because the timestamps are usually lower.

Computers with clock skew lower than selected in config file are not stored.
This is useful if you have synchronized clocks on the monitoring computer and
the detected computers have also synchronized clocks and thus their clock skew
is very low and it is not possible to differentiate between these computers.
Therefore, the computers running NTP most probably will not be listed as active.
If this is not what you want, you are able to lower the THRESHOLD.

A correction is applied to computed frequencies:
freq >= 970 && freq <= 1030	=>	freq = 1000
freq >= 230 && freq <= 270	=>	freq = 250
freq >= 95 && freq <= 105	=>	freq = 100
In many cases this means that the frequency is fixed but sometimes it may result
to wrong frequency because some systems may use unusual frequency.


Project origins
---------------

The very first revision in the pcf repository (https://github.com/polcak/pcf) is
the result of diploma thesis of Jakub Jirasek, which was successfuly finished at
Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology. You can see
the report on http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/DP/DP.php.en?id=14040&y=2011 (the
text is in Czech).

The idea of computer identification based on TCP timestamps was first published
in:
Kohno, T.; Broido, A.; Claffy, K.: Remote physical device fingerprinting. IEEE
Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, volume 2, no. 2, May 2005: pp.
93–108, ISSN 1545-5971.
